## DISCLAIMER:
Crimson Credit Union is an educational website for developing healthy cyber security practices, **not a real financial institution**! None of the people who are mentioned in this site are real. Any resemblance to the real world or real people is coincidental and not intentional by the creators of this site.

Please bank responsibly.

Verify information you find on the web.

## Purpose
Crimson Credit Union was created to teach emerging cyber security students about phishing, spearphishing, vishing, and social engineering attacks. In today's world, these methods are typically used against financial institutions, which this website seeks to mimic. This website is used to aid in demonstrations and real-life simulations of professional cyber security industry incident response procedures and penetration testing.

## AI Use Note:
The textual and image contents of this website were largely created with generative AI. All images except for the company logo, banner, and favicon were created with Canva's AI. 

This website was created to serve an educational purpose for cyber security exercises and is by no means meant to appear real. The use of AI art is deliberate to dissuade real people from assuming Crimson Credit Union is a real credit union. Thus, photos of real people would be inappropriate for use in a project such as this. This project is not for profit and does not generate any revenue, therefore real artists in the industry were not impacted.

Pay your artists.
